/// A [StreamBuilderBase] is stateful and maintains a summary of the interaction
/// so far. The type of the summary and how it is updated with each interaction
/// is defined by sub-classes.
///
/// Examples of summaries include:
///
/// * the running average of a stream of integers;
/// * the current direction and speed based on a stream of geolocation data;
/// * a graph displaying data points from a stream.
///
/// In general, the summary is the result of a fold computation over the data
/// items and errors received from the stream along with pseudo-events
/// representing termination or change of stream. The initial summary is
/// specified by sub-classes by overriding [initial]. The summary updates on
/// receipt of stream data and errors are specified by overriding [afterData] and
/// [afterError], respectively. If needed, the summary may be updated on stream
/// termination by overriding [afterDone]. Finally, the summary may be updated
/// on change of stream by overriding [afterDisconnected] and [afterConnected].
///
/// [T] is the type of stream events.
/// [S] is the type of interaction summary.

///
